# Design Thinking for Blockchains

Decentralization Method Sheet is an open source method for creative and collaborative protocol design.

Considering blockchains will have a significant impact on all walks of life, protocol design should be a multi-disciplinary activity and include a variety of inputs in the conception stage to prevent creator biases being baked into platforms. We developed a unique methodology with this purpose by combining elements of design thinking, network science, and crypto economics. All disciplines and experience levels are invited to partake in designing new blockchains for a variety of domains.

We utilized this method in [Design Thinking for Blockchains workshops](http://patara.io/workshop/), where participants with little to no technical background were able to partake in designing new protocols.
